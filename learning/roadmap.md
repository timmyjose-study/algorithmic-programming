# Roadmap

First step - learn the essential fundamentals.

## Data Structures

1. Dynamic Array

2. Linked List

3. Stack & Queue

4. Hash Tables

5. Binary Search Tree

6. Binary Heaps & Priority Queue

7. Graphs

8. Trie


## Algorithms

1. Bit Manipulation and Numbers (signed and unsigned numbers)

2. Stability in Sorting

3. Merge Sort

4. Quick Sort

5. Heap Sort - O(1) in-place sort

6. Binary Search

7. Selections - Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums)

8. Permutations

9. Subsets

10. BFS (Graph)

11. DFS (Graph)

12. Dijkstra's Algorithm

13. Tree Traversals - BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order), recursive and iterative

14. External Sort (concept)

15. Topological Sort

16. NP-Complete (concept)

17. Detect cycle in a Directed Graph

18. Count Connected Components in a Graph


## Prep Work

After mastering the data structures and algorithms above, practise the following till it becomes second-nature.

1. Implement an ArrayList from scratch

2. Reverse a Linked List

3. Implement a Stack and Queue using an array

4. Implement a Hash Table with simple hashing functions

5. Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write BFS and DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order), iterative and recursive

6. Implement Binary Search using iterative and recursive methods

9. Implement Merge Sort

10. Implement Quick Sort

11. Print Binary Trees using BFS and DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

12. Memorise time and space complexities for common algorithms (https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

13. Implement a Trie

14. Learn Bit-Manipulation tricks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-tricks-competitive-programming/)
